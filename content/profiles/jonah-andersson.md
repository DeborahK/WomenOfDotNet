### About me

##### **Microsoft MVP, Software Engineer, Azure Developer, MCT, Speaker, Mentor, Author **

I love programming and I code fullstack development in C# .NET. I like the challeng of solving complex problems, programming back-end because I enjoy using my mind to find out and dig 
deeper into the invisible logic behind a botton. I have great interest in developing applications in .NET with Microsoft Azure cloud technologies even on my free time. 

I like continuous learning and development with Microsoft Azure and I passionately share my technical knowledge to others publicly and even at my workplace.
You will also find me making difference by advocating tech, gender equality, diversity and inclusion. 
A role-model and a mentor to some young women in Sweden and internationally. 

I am the founder and organizer of Azure User Group Sundsvall - Sweden, https://www.meetup.com/azureusergroupsundsvallsverige

Also blog a lot about Azure and my tech communities engagements on my website https://www.jonahandersson.tech
