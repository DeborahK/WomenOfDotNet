# #WomenOFDotNet
Hello and welcome to the source code for the [WomenOfDot.NEt](https://womenofdot.net) project.

## Adding yourself to the profiles index.

Please use the MD template found [here](https://github.com/Layla-P/WomenOfDotNet/blob/main/content/profiles/template-please-copy.md) to create your profile - viewing it in raw form will make life easier!
Add a cover photo for the index page and a profile picture to your personal page into this [folder](https://github.com/Layla-P/WomenOfDotNet/tree/main/static/images/profile-pictures).

You can say as much or as little about yourself as you like!

Add in information about your current talks or upcoming events. This page can serve you just as well as the community <3

Feel free to add more photos if needed, just pop them in a folder within `static\images`!
